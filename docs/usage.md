# Usage

## Input collection

Before auditing, `zizmor` performs an input collection phase.

There are three input sources that `zizmor` knows about:

1. Individual workflow and composite action files, e.g. `foo.yml` and
   `my-action/action.yml`;
2. "Local" GitHub repositories in the form of a directory, e.g. `my-repo/`;
3. "Remote" GitHub repositories in the form of a "slug", e.g.
   `pypa/sampleproject`.

    !!! tip

        By default, a remote repository will be audited from the `HEAD`
        of the default branch. To control this, you can append a `git`
        reference to the slug:

        ```bash
        # audit at HEAD on the default branch
        zizmor example/example

        # audit at branch or tag `v1`
        zizmor example/example@v1

        # audit at a specific SHA
        zizmor example/example@abababab...
        ```

    !!! tip

        Remote auditing requires Internet access and a GitHub API token.
        See [Operating Modes](#operating-modes) and
        [GitHub API token permissions](#github-api-token-permissions) for more
        information.

`zizmor` can audit multiple inputs in the same run, and different input
sources can be mixed and matched:

```bash
# audit a single local workflow, an entire local repository, and
# a remote repository all in the same run
zizmor ../example.yml ../other-repo/ example/example
```

When auditing local and/or remote repositories, `zizmor` will collect both
workflows (e.g. `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) **and** action definitions
(e.g. `custom-action/foo.yml`) by default. To configure collection behavior,
you can use the `--collect=...` option.

```bash
# collect everything regardless of `.gitignore` patterns
zizmor --collect=all example/example

# collect everything while respecting `.gitignore` patterns (the default)
zizmor --collect=default example/example

# collect only workflows
zizmor --collect=workflows-only example/example

# collect only actions
zizmor --collect=actions-only example/example
```

!!! tip

    `--collect=all` can be significantly slower than `--collect=default`,
    particularly when collecting from directories that contain large
    hierarchies of paths that would be ignored by `.gitignore` patterns.

!!! tip

    `--collect=...` only controls input collection from repository input
    sources. In other words, `zizmor --collect=actions-only workflow.yml`
    *will* audit `workflow.yml`, since it was passed explicitly and not
    collected indirectly.

By default, `zizmor` will warn (but not fail) if it fails to parse a
workflow or action definition. To turn these warnings into failures,
you can use the `--strict-collection` option:

```bash
# fail if any files collected from example/example fail to parse
zizmor --strict-collection example/example
```

!!! important

    `--strict-collection` is available in `v1.7.0` and later.

## Operating Modes

`zizmor` has three *operating modes*:

* **Offline**: `zizmor` will not access the Internet,
  will not fetch remote repositories, and will not perform
  any audits that require online access (e.g. to the GitHub API).
* **Online**: `zizmor` will fetch remote repositories
  as necessary, and will perform all audits that require
  online access.
* **Online sans audits**: `zizmor` will fetch remote repositories
  as necessary, but will skip any audits that require online access.

`zizmor` attempts to select a default operating mode based on the user's
environment:

- If `ZIZMOR_OFFLINE` is set, then `zizmor` runs in offline mode.
- If `GH_TOKEN` is set, then `zizmor` runs in online mode with audits.
    - Additionally `ZIZMOR_NO_ONLINE_AUDITS` is set, then `zizmor` runs
      online sans audits.
- If neither `ZIZMOR_OFFLINE` nor `GH_TOKEN` are set, then `zizmor` runs
  in offline mode.

Or, as a flowchart:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  B{ZIZMOR_OFFLINE set?} -- Yes --> C[Offline mode]
  B -- No --> D{GH_TOKEN set?}
  D -- No --> C
  D -- Yes --> E{ZIZMOR_NO_ONLINE_AUDITS set?}
  E -- Yes --> F[Online sans audits mode]
  E -- No --> G[Online mode]
```

Each operating mode can also be made explicit through command-line flags:

```bash
# force offline, even if a GH_TOKEN is present
# this disables all online actions, including repository fetches
zizmor --offline workflow.yml

# passing a token explicitly will enable online mode
# in this case, we use the `gh` CLI token
zizmor --gh-token $(gh auth token) workflow.yml

# online for the purpose of fetching the input (example/example),
# but all audits themselves are offline
zizmor --no-online-audits --gh-token $(gh auth token) example/example
```

### GitHub API token permissions

!!! tip

    If you're running `zizmor` locally with an online mode, it is
    **strongly recommended** that you use `gh auth token` from the [GitHub CLI]
    to automatically access an API token and avoid error-prone manual
    provisioning.

    This token is almost always pre-configured with sufficient permissions,
    meaning that you **do not** need any of the manual steps below.

    [GitHub CLI]: https://cli.github.com/

When running in an online mode, `zizmor` uses the GitHub API for
various operations, including fetching a repository's contents
(for the collection phase) and fetching tag/branch/commit histories
(for the auditing phase).

Generally speaking, `zizmor` does **not** require any special permissions
from its GitHub API token: it uses the token *primarily* to provide
authentication for rate-limited API requests.

However, if you are auditing a private remote repository (e.g.
`zizmor myorg/private-repo`) or auditing _any_ input that contains
private references (e.g. `#!yaml uses: myorg/private-action`), then
you may need to provision permissions for the token:

- `#!yaml contents: read` for GitHub Actions
- `repo` for OAuth tokens and "classic" PATs
- An appropriate repository access scope for fine-grained PATs

In addition to these permissions, some integrations of `zizmor`
(like GitHub Advanced Security) may require additional permissions
in the context of GitHub Actions. See
[Use in GitHub Actions](#use-in-github-actions) for more details.

## Output formats

`zizmor` always produces output on `stdout`.

See [Integration](#integration) for suggestions on when to use each format.

### Cargo-style output ("plain")

By default, `zizmor` produces `cargo`-style diagnostic output.

```console
error[template-injection]: code injection via template expansion
  --> ./tests/integration/test-data/template-injection/pr-425-backstop/action.yml:28:7
   |
28 |     - name: case4
   |       ^^^^^^^^^^^ this step
29 |       uses: azure/powershell
30 |       with:
31 |         inlineScript: Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "${{ inputs.expandme }}"
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ inputs.expandme may expand into attacker-controllable code
   |
   = note: audit confidence â†’ Low
```

This output will be colorized by default when sent to a supporting terminal and
uncolorized by default when piped to another program. Users can also explicitly
disable output colorization by setting `NO_COLOR=1` in their environment.

This format can also be explicitly selected with `--format=plain`.

### JSON

!!! important

    The JSON format is versioned, and `--format=json` is an alias for the
    current version.

    The current version of the JSON format is `v1`. You can use
    `--format=json-v1` to explicitly select the current version.

    The following compatibility policy is used for JSON format versions:

    1. The current version of the format is always aliased as `json`.
    2. When a new version of the JSON format is added, `--format=json`
       will show a deprecation warning, and will transition to the new version
       with the next major release.
    3. When a new version of the JSON format is added, explicit uses of the
       old version will show a deprecation warning.
    4. The old version will be removed in the *subsequent* major release
       (i.e., the major release after the one that transitions the `json` alias).

!!! important

    `--format=json-v1` is available in `v1.6.0` and later.

With `--format=json`, `zizmor` will produce a flat array of findings in
JSON format:

```bash
zizmor --format=json . | jq .[0]
```

      ],
      "ignored": false
    }
    ```


### SARIF

`zizmor` supports [SARIF] via `--format=sarif`.
SARIF is a JSON-based standard for representing static analysis results.

See [Use in GitHub Actions](#use-in-github-actions) for
information on using `zizmor` with GitHub's Advanced Security
functionality via GitHub Actions.

### GitHub Annotations

!!! note

    `--format=github` is available in `v1.6.0` and later.

`zizmor` supports GitHub annotations via `--format=github`.

See [Workflow Commands for GitHub Actions] for additional information about
annotations.

!!! warning

    GitHub annotations come with significant limitations: a single CI step
    can only render 10 annotations at a time.

    If your `zizmor` run produces more than 10 findings, only the first 10 will
    be rendered; all subsequent findings will be logged in the actions log but
    **will not be rendered** as annotations.

    See orgs/community?26680 and orgs/community?68471 for additional
    information.


## Exit codes

!!! note

    Exit codes 10 and above are **not used** if `--no-exit-codes` or
    `--format sarif` is passed.

`zizmor` uses various exit codes to summarize the results of a run:

| Code | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| 0    | Successful audit; no findings to report (or SARIF mode enabled). |
| 1    | Error during audit; consult output. |
| 10   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "unknown" level. |
| 11   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "informational" level. |
| 12   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "low" level. |
| 13   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "medium" level. |
| 14   | One or more findings found; highest finding is "high" level. |

All other exit codes are currently reserved.

## Using personas

!!! tip

    `--persona=...` is available in `v0.7.0` and later.

`zizmor` comes with three pre-defined "personas," which dictate how
sensitive `zizmor`'s analyses are:

* The _regular persona_: the user wants high-signal, low-noise, actionable
  security findings. This persona is best for ordinary local use as well as use
  in most CI/CD setups, which is why it's the default.

    !!! note

        This persona can be made explicit with `--persona=regular`,
        although this is not required.


* The _pedantic persona_, enabled with `--persona=pedantic`: the user wants
  *code smells* in addition to regular, actionable security findings.

    This persona is ideal for finding things that are a good idea
    to clean up or resolve, but are likely not immediately actionable
    security findings (or are actionable, but suggest a intentional
    security decision by the workflow/action author).

    For example, using the pedantic persona will flag the following
    with an `unpinned-uses` finding, since it uses a symbolic reference
    as its pin instead of a hashed pin:

    ```yaml
    uses: actions/checkout@v3
    ```

    produces:

    ```console
    $ zizmor --pedantic tests/test-data/unpinned-uses.yml
    help[unpinned-uses]: unpinned action reference
      --> tests/test-data/unpinned-uses.yml:14:9
       |
    14 |       - uses: actions/checkout@v3
       |         ------------------------- help: action is not pinned to a hash ref
       |
       = note: audit confidence â†’ High
    ```

    !!! tip

        This persona can also be enabled with `--pedantic`, which is
        an alias for `--persona=pedantic`.

* The _auditor persona_, enabled with `--persona=auditor`: the user wants
  *everything* flagged by `zizmor`, including findings that are likely
  to be false positives.

    This persona is ideal for security auditors and code reviewers, who
    want to go through `zizmor`'s findings manually with a fine-toothed comb.

!!! tip

    Some audits, notably [`self-hosted-runner`](./audits.md#self-hosted-runner),
    *only* produce auditor-level results. This is because these audits require
    runtime context that `zizmor` lacks access to by design, meaning that their
    results are always subject to false positives.

    For example, with the default persona:

    ```console
    $ zizmor tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml
    ðŸŒˆ completed self-hosted.yml
    No findings to report. Good job! (1 suppressed)
    ```

    and with `--persona=auditor`:

    ```console
    $ zizmor --persona=auditor tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml
    note[self-hosted-runner]: runs on a self-hosted runner
      --> tests/test-data/self-hosted.yml:8:5
        |
      8 |     runs-on: [self-hosted, my-ubuntu-box]
        |     ------------------------------------- note: self-hosted runner used here
        |
        = note: audit confidence â†’ High

      1 finding: 1 unknown, 0 informational, 0 low, 0 medium, 0 high
    ```

## Auto-fixing results *&#8203;*{.chip .chip-experimental} { #auto-fixing-results }

!!! warning

    `zizmor`'s auto-fix mode is currently **experimental** and subject to
    breaking changes.

    You **will** encounter bugs while experimenting with it;
    please [file them]!

    [file them]: https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor/issues/new?template=bug-report.yml

!!! tip

    `--fix=[MODE]` is available in `v1.10.0` and later.

Starting with `v1.10.0`, `zizmor` can automatically fix a subset of its findings.

Auto-fixable findings are marked with an additional `note:` annotation
beneath their body, e.g.:

```console hl_lines="10"
error[template-injection]: code injection via template expansion
  --> example.yml:18:36
   |
17 |       - run: |
   |         ^^^ this run block
18 |           echo "doing a thing: ${{ inputs.test }}"
   |                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^ may expand into attacker-controllable code
   |
   = note: audit confidence â†’ High
   = note: this finding has an auto-fix
```

To attempt auto-fixes for *safe* fixes, you can use the `--fix` or
`--fix=safe` option:

```bash
# these two are equivalent
zizmor --fix example.yml
zizmor --fix=safe example.yml
```

### Unsafe fixes

!!! important

    Unsafe fixes **must** be manually reviewed for semantic correctness.

By default, `--fix` will only apply *safe* fixes, i.e. fixes that are
safe to apply with minimal human oversight due to their low breakage risk.

Not all changes are safe, however, and `zizmor` offers *unsafe* fixes
for some findings as well. These fixes are *often* correct, but require
human review.

To apply *unsafe* fixes, you can either use `--fix=all` (to enable both
safe and unsafe fixes) or `--fix=unsafe-only` (to enable only unsafe fixes):

```bash
zizmor --fix=all example.yml
zizmor --fix=unsafe-only example.yml
```

### Limitations

`zizmor`'s auto-fix mode has several limitations that are important
to keep in mind:

* **In-place modification**: `--fix=[MODE]` modifies fixable inputs
  in-place, meaning that the original files will be modified.
* **No remote fixes**: as a corollary to the above, `--fix=[MODE]`
  does not support remote inputs (e.g. `zizmor example/example`).
* **Format preservation**: `--fix=[MODE]` attempts to preserve
  the original format of the input files, including exact indentation
  and comments. However, this is ultimately a heuristic, and
  some patches may not match the file's exact style.

## Filtering results

There are two straightforward ways to filter `zizmor`'s results:

1. If all you need is severity or confidence filtering (e.g. "I want only
   medium-severity and/or medium-confidence and above results"), then you can use
   the `--min-severity` and `--min-confidence` flags:

    !!! tip

        `--min-severity` and `--min-confidence` are available in `v0.6.0` and later.

     ```bash
     # filter unknown, informational, and low findings with unknown, low confidence
     zizmor --min-severity=medium --min-confidence=medium ...
     ```

2. If you need more advanced filtering (with nontrivial conditions or
   state considerations), then consider using `--format=json` and using
   `jq` (or a script) to perform your filtering.

     As a starting point, here's how you can use `jq` to filter `zizmor`'s
     JSON output to only results that are marked as "high confidence":

     ```bash
     zizmor --format=json-v1 ... | jq 'map(select(.determinations.confidence == "High"))'
     ```

## Ignoring results

`zizmor`'s defaults are not always 100% right for every possible use case.

If you find that `zizmor` produces findings that aren't right for you
(and **aren't** false positives, which should be reported!), then you can
choose to *selectively ignore* results via either special ignore comments
*or* a `zizmor.yml` configuration file.

### With comments

!!! note

    Ignore comment support was added in `v0.6.0`.

Findings can be ignored inline with `# zizmor: ignore[rulename]` comments.
This is ideal for one-off ignores, where a whole `zizmor.yml` configuration
file would be too heavyweight.

Multiple different audits can be ignored with a single comment by
separating each rule with a comma, e.g.
`# zizmor: ignore[artipacked,ref-confusion]`.

To ignore a single `template-injection` finding:

```yaml title="example.yml"
run: | # zizmor: ignore[template-injection]
  echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
```

Ignore comments can also have a trailing explanation:

```yaml title="example.yml"
run: | # zizmor: ignore[template-injection] i promise this is safe
  echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
```

!!! important

    An ignore comment can be placed anywhere in any span identified by a finding,
    **so long** as it can be identified as a YAML comment. In particular,
    this means that you **can't** place an ignore comment in the middle of a string
    or a block literal. For example, the following does not work:

    ```yaml title="example.yml"
    # this is not suppressed, since the comment is actually part of the string
    run: |
      echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}" # zizmor: ignore[template-injection]
    ```

    To fix this, you should place the ignore comment outside of the string,
    e.g. directly above it:

    ```yaml title="example.yml"
    run: | # zizmor: ignore[template-injection]
      echo "${{ github.event.issue.title }}"
    ```

### With `zizmor.yml`

When ignoring multiple findings (or entire files), a `zizmor.yml` configuration
file is easier to maintain than one-off comments.

Here's what a `zizmor.yml` file might look like:

```yaml title="zizmor.yml"
rules:
  template-injection:
    ignore:
      - safe.yml
      - somewhat-safe.yml:123
      - one-exact-spot.yml:123:456
```

Concretely, this `zizmor.yml` configuration declares three ignore rules,
all for the [`template-injection`](./audits.md#template-injection) audit:

1. Ignore all findings in `safe.yml`, regardless of line/column location
2. Ignore *any* findings in `somewhat-safe.yml` that occur on line 123
3. Ignore *one* finding in `one-exact-spot.yml` that occurs on line 123, column 456

More generally, the filename ignore syntax is `workflow.yml:line:col`, where
`line` and `col` are both optional and 1-based (meaning `foo.yml:1:1`
is the start of the file, not `foo.yml:0:0`).

To pass a configuration to `zizmor`, you can either place `zizmor.yml`
somewhere where `zizmor` [will discover it], or pass it explicitly via
the `--config` argument. With `--config`, the file can be named anything:

```bash
zizmor --config my-zizmor-config.yml /dir/to/audit
```

!!! tip

    Starting with `v1.8.0`, you can use the `ZIZMOR_CONFIG` environment
    variable to specify a configuration file.

    `ZIZMOR_CONFIG=my-config.yml` is equivalent to
    `--config my-config.yml`.

[will discover it]: ./configuration.md#precedence

See [Configuration: `rules.<id>.ignore`](./configuration.md#rulesidignore) for
more details on writing ignore rules.

## Caching between runs

!!! tip

    Persistent caching (between runs of `zizmor`) is available in `v0.10.0` and later.

!!! warning

    Caches can contain sensitive metadata, especially when auditing private
    repositories! Think twice before sharing your cache or reusing
    it across machine/visibility boundaries.

`zizmor` caches HTTP responses from GitHub's REST APIs to speed up individual
audits. This HTTP cache is persisted and re-used between runs as well.

By default `zizmor` will cache to an appropriate user-level caching directory:

* Linux and macOS: `$XDG_CACHE_DIR` (`~/.cache/zizmor` by default)
* Windows: `~\AppData\Roaming\woodruffw\zizmor`.

To override the default caching directory, pass `--cache-dir`:

```bash
# cache in /tmp instead
zizmor --cache-dir /tmp/zizmor ...
```

## Integration

### Use in GitHub Actions

`zizmor` is designed to integrate with GitHub Actions.

The easiest way to use `zizmor` in GitHub Actions is
with @zizmorcore/zizmor-action. However, expert users or those who want
more fine-grained control over their integration can also use the
[Manual integration](#manual-integration) steps further below.

#### With @zizmorcore/zizmor-action *&#8203;*{.chip .chip-recommended}

To get started with @zizmorcore/zizmor-action, you can use the following
workflow skeleton:

```yaml title="zizmor.yml"

    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["**"]

#### Manual integration *&#8203;*{.chip .chip-expert}

If you don't want to use @zizmorcore/zizmor-action, you can always
use `zizmor` directly in your GitHub Actions workflows.

All of the same functionality is available, but you'll need to do a bit
more explicit scaffolding.

There are two main ways to manually integrate `zizmor` into your
GitHub Actions setup:

1. With `--format=sarif` via Advanced Security *&#8203;*{.chip .chip-recommended}
2. With `--format=github` via GitHub Annotations

=== "With Advanced Security *&#8203;*{.chip .chip-recommended}"

    GitHub's Advanced Security and [code scanning functionality] supports
    [SARIF], which `zizmor` can produce via `--format=sarif`.

    !!! important

        The workflow below performs a [SARIF] upload, which is available for public
        repositories and for GitHub Enterprise Cloud organizations that have
        [Advanced Security]. If neither of these apply to you, then you can
        use `--format=github` or adapt the `--format=json` or `--format=plain`
        output formats to your needs.

    ```yaml title="zizmor.yml"
    name: GitHub Actions Security Analysis with zizmor ðŸŒˆ

    on:
      push:
        branches: ["main"]
      pull_request:
        branches: ["**"]

    permissions: {}

    jobs:
      zizmor:
        name: zizmor latest via PyPI
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
          security-events: write # needed for SARIF uploads
          contents: read # only needed for private repos
          actions: read # only needed for private repos
        steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2
            with:
              persist-credentials: false

          - name: Install the latest version of uv
            uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@6b9c6063abd6010835644d4c2e1bef4cf5cd0fca # v6.0.1

          - name: Run zizmor ðŸŒˆ
            run: uvx zizmor --format=sarif . > results.sarif # (2)!
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # (1)!

          - name: Upload SARIF file
            uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@ff0a06e83cb2de871e5a09832bc6a81e7276941f # v3.28.18
            with:
              sarif_file: results.sarif
              category: zizmor
    ```

    1. Optional: Remove the `env:` block to only run `zizmor`'s offline audits.

    2. This installs the [zizmor package from PyPI], since it's pre-compiled
       and therefore completes much faster. You could instead compile `zizmor`
       within CI/CD with `cargo install zizmor`.

    For more inspiration, see `zizmor`'s own [repository workflow scan], as well
    as GitHub's example of [running ESLint] as a security workflow.

    !!! important

        When using `--format=sarif`, `zizmor` does not use its
        [exit codes](#exit-codes) to signal the presence of findings. As a result,
        `zizmor` will always exit with code `0` even if findings are present,
        **unless** an internal error occurs during the audit.

        As a result of this, the `zizmor.yml` workflow itself will always
        succeed, resulting in a green checkmark in GitHub Actions.
        This should **not** be confused with a lack of findings.

        To prevent a branch from being merged with findings present, you can
        use GitHub's rulesets feature. For more information, see
        [About code scanning alerts - Pull request check failures for code scanning alerts].

=== "With annotations"

    A simpler (but more limited) way to use `zizmor` in GitHub Actions is
    with annotations, which `zizmor` can produce via `--format=github`.

    This is a good option if:

    1. You don't have Advanced Security (or you don't want to use it)
    1. You don't want to run `zizmor` with `security-events: write`

    ```yaml title="zizmor.yml"
    name: GitHub Actions Security Analysis with zizmor ðŸŒˆ

    on:
      push:
        branches: ["main"]
      pull_request:
        branches: ["**"]

    jobs:
      zizmor:
        name: zizmor latest via PyPI
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
          contents: read # only needed for private repos
          actions: read # only needed for private repos
        steps:
          - name: Checkout repository
            uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 # v4.2.2

          - name: Install the latest version of uv
            uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@6b9c6063abd6010835644d4c2e1bef4cf5cd0fca # v6.0.1

          - name: Run zizmor ðŸŒˆ
            run: uvx zizmor --format=github . # (2)!
            env:
              GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # (1)!
    ```

    1. Optional: Remove the `env:` block to only run `zizmor`'s offline audits.

    2. This installs the [zizmor package from PyPI], since it's pre-compiled
       and therefore completes much faster. You could instead compile `zizmor`
       within CI/CD with `cargo install zizmor`.

    !!! warning

        GitHub Actions has a limit of 10 annotations per step.

        If your `zizmor` run produces more than 10 findings, only the first 10 will
        be rendered; all subsequent findings will be logged in the actions log but
        **will not be rendered** as annotations.

### Use with GitHub Enterprise

`zizmor` supports GitHub instances other than `github.com`.

To use it with your [GitHub Enterprise] instance (either cloud or self-hosted),
pass your instance's domain with `--gh-hostname` or `GH_HOST`:

```bash
zizmor --gh-hostname custom.example.com ...

# or, with GH_HOST
GH_HOST=custom.ghe.com zizmor ...
```

[GitHub Enterprise]: https://github.com/enterprise

### Use with `pre-commit`

`zizmor` can be used with the [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework.
To do so, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` `repos` section:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/zizmorcore/zizmor-pre-commit
  rev: v1.10.0 # (1)!
  hooks:
  - id: zizmor
```

1. Don't forget to update this version to the latest `zizmor` release!

This will run `zizmor` on every commit.

!!! tip

    If you want to run `zizmor` only on specific files, you can use the
    `files` option. This setting is *optional*, as `zizmor` will
    scan the entire repository by default.

    See [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) documentation for more
    information on how to configure `pre-commit`.

### Color customization

When invoked from a terminal, `zizmor` will attempt to enrich its output
with ANSI colors.

!!! note

    `--color` is available in `v1.5.0` and later.

Some users may prefer to explicitly enable or disable this behavior. For
example, GitHub Actions is not a terminal but it does support ANSI colors,
so enabling colors in GitHub Actions can make logs more readable.

To explicitly control `zizmor`'s colorization behavior, use the
`--color` option:

```bash
# force colorization
zizmor --color=always ...

# force no colorization
zizmor --color=never ...
```

`zizmor` also respects various environment variables for colorization:

* [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/): if set to any value, disables colorization
* [`FORCE_COLOR`](https://force-color.org/): if set to any value, enables colorization
* [`CLICOLOR_FORCE`](https://bixense.com/clicolors/): if set to any value, enables colorization

### Tab completion

!!! note

    Tab completion is available in `v1.7.0` and later.

`zizmor` comes with built-in tab completion. It supports all of the
shells supported by [`clap_complete`](https://crates.io/crates/clap_complete),
which includes popular shells like `bash`, `zsh`, and `fish`.

To enable tab completion, you can use the `--completions=<shell>` flag
to emit a completion script for the specified shell. For example,
to enable tab completion for `bash`, you can run:

```bash
zizmor --completions=bash > ~/.bash_completion.d/zizmor # (1)!
```

1. The correct location of your completion script will depend on your
   shell and its configuration. Consult your shell's documentation
   for more information.

## Limitations

`zizmor` can help you write more secure GitHub workflow and action definitions,
as well as help you find exploitable bugs in existing definitions.

However, like all tools, `zizmor` is **not a panacea**, and has
fundamental limitations that must be kept in mind. This page
documents some of those limitations.

### `zizmor` is a _static_ analysis tool

`zizmor` is a _static_ analysis tool. It never executes any code, nor does it
have access to any runtime state.

In contrast, GitHub Actions workflow and action definitions are highly
dynamic, and can be influenced by inputs that can only be inspected at
runtime.

For example, here is a workflow where a job's matrix is generated
at runtime by a previous job, making the matrix impossible to
analyze statically:

```yaml
build-matrix:
  name: Build the matrix
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  outputs:
    matrix: ${{ steps.set-matrix.outputs.matrix }}
  steps:
    - id: set-matrix
      run: |
        echo "matrix=$(python generate_matrix.py)" >> "${GITHUB_OUTPUT}"

run:
  name: ${{ matrix.name }}
  needs:
    - build-matrix
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix: ${{ fromJson(needs.build-matrix.outputs.matrix) }}
  steps:
    - run: |
        echo "hello ${{ matrix.something }}"
```

In the above, the expansion of `${{ matrix.something }}` is entirely controlled
by the output of `generate_matrix.py`, which is only known at runtime.

In such cases, `zizmor` will err on the side of verbosity. For example,
the [template-injection](./audits.md#template-injection) audit will flag
`${{ matrix.something }}` as a potential code injection risk, since it
can't infer anything about what `matrix.something` might expand to.

### `zizmor` audits workflow and action _definitions_ only

`zizmor` audits workflow and action _definitions_ only. That means the
contents of `foo.yml` (for your workflow definitions) or `action.yml` (for your
composite action definitions).

In practice, this means that `zizmor` does **not** analyze other files
referenced by workflow and action definitions. For example:

```yaml
example:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - name: step-1
      run: |
        echo foo=$(bar) >> $GITHUB_ENV

    - name: step-2
      run: |
        # some-script.sh contains the same code as step-1
        ./some-script.sh
```

`zizmor` can analyze `step-1` above, because the code it executes
is present within the workflow definition itself. It *cannot* analyze
`step-2` beyond the presence of a script execution, since it doesn't
audit shell scripts or any other kind of files.

More generally, `zizmor` cannot analyze files indirectly referenced within
workflow/action definitions, as they may not actually exist until runtime.
For example, `some-script.sh` above may have been generated or downloaded
outside of any repository-tracked state.
