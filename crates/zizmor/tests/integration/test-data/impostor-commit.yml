# impostor-commit.yml
#
# what:
# an example of commit impersonation. GitHub repositories and their forks
# share a "network" of commit objects, meaning that GitHub's backend
# can't easily distinguish between them. as a result, workflows that
# appear to be pinned to a hash on a specific repo may actually be pinned
# to a hash within a different fork repo, which can be malicious.
#
# how:
# a user is unlikely to accidentally write a malicious commit, but may merge
# an otherwise innocent-looking change from a third party without realizing
# that the commits pinned by that party are actually references to a malicious
# fork.
